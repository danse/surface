All files but configuration.php will be concatenated by the Makefile
into a single php file (server.php) to ease uploading to webservers

File Contents:
________________________________________________________________

configuration.php

  Configuration variables (into the form of php variables) to be used
  by the administrator

main.php

  The main entry point to the server, where different request types
  are paired with the right functions (often, one function accessing
  the database and one function to print the output) with a big switch
  
updates.php

  All functions that touch the database (that means the various text
  files keeping the server side of the application state) are here.

file_access.php

  This file is used only by functions into update.php; it contains
  functions to read and write the database files, locking them.

markup_send.php

  Contains all functions for html and xml output

draw_image.php

  Contains the function draw_image, called into the main switch

fpdf.php

  Imported by draw_image.php, provides functions to draw a vectorial
  pdf
