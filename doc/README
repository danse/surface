This directory contains documentation about the application.

The guides are written using the "rst" markup language documented at
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

To generate html or other formats you need to use the docutils scripts
like 'rst2html' or 'rst2latex'. These are included into the port
py26-docutils for FreeBSD and into the package python-docutils for
Ubuntu. They require that python 2.3 or later is installed on your
system.

Once docutils is present on your system, you can type 'make' to build
the documentation using the included GNU makefile (this is necessary
only after you change the .rst source files)
