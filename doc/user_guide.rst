User guide
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This document collects just few hints about the use of the web
whiteboard, since most of the operations should be straightforward.

To properly use the application, you must be **connected** to the
server (the application continuously exchanges messages with it), you
must have **javascript** activated (it is activated normally, unless
you disabled it on purpose) and the page must be enabled to open
**popups**. If you are using *Internet Explorer*, you must have the
*Flash player* installed; if you don't have it you can find a copy
`here <www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/>`_.

Registration and login
________________________________________________________________

To use the whiteboard you must be registered. Just choose a name and a
password and remember them! If no whiteboards are present or you can't
access the present ones, try to create a new whiteboard.

User permissions
................................................................

To register on the server and to create, delete, and access a
whiteboard, the administrator must have configured the application to
recognize your user name. You could have the permissions to access to
only some of the existent whiteboards, and to create whiteboards with
a given name and not with arbitrary names. If there are problems with
these operations, the reason could be the permissions granted to your
user name.

Uncommon operations
________________________________________________________________

Just few tips about some operations whose use you could not understand
immediately.

Navigate links
................................................................

To open a link written on the whiteboard, use the **select**
tool. This is the only function of that tool!

Drag delete
................................................................

With the 'Delete' tool, if there are many thin paths on the whiteboard,
you can delete them holding down the mouse button and moving the
pointer around.

Images
................................................................


Including images from the web
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To insert images from the web into the whiteboard, use the "image"
button and insert the *url* (internet address) of the image into the
text area. Changing the "scale ratio" will change the image
dimensions.

Image resize
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

An image can be resized acting on the "image scaling factor" input
field when it is created. An existent image can be resized using the
'Edit' tool on it:

- click on 'Edit' and than on the image
- jump to the "image scaling factor" and modify it
- jump again the the text area with the image address and press enter
  to confirm the modified image

The scaling factor on edited images is applied to the original sizes.

Export and resize inconsistencies
________________________________________________________________

You may find some inconsistencies while exporting or resizing the
whiteboard. These can concern the shape of circles (they will remain
circles even when resized), the aspect ratio of images, and the text
size (the size doesn't changes with resizes). I apologize for that!
